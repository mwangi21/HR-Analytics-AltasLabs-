# AtlasLabs-HR-Analytics-PowerBI

## Project Overview
This project is an HR Analytics dashboard developed in Power BI for a fictitious software company, Atlas Labs. It was created as part of DataCamp's *Case Study: HR Analytics in Power BI* course, and it covers various aspects of HR data analysis, from data modeling to interactive visualizations.

### Key Features
- **Employee Demographics Analysis**: Analyze employee age, gender, and ethnic diversity to support the company's Diversity and Inclusion goals.
- **Hiring Trends**: Understand trends in employee hiring over time to assist in strategic workforce planning.
- **Performance Tracking**: Track individual employee performance scores based on yearly performance reviews.
- **Attrition Analysis**: Examine factors influencing employee attrition, including travel frequency, to support retention efforts.
- **Interactive Navigation**: Easy-to-navigate report with page navigation for enhanced user experience.

### Project Highlights
- **Data Modeling and EDA**: Imported HR datasets, created relationships between tables, and performed exploratory data analysis on HR metrics.
- **DAX Calculations**: Utilized DAX functions like `CALCULATE` and `USERELATIONSHIP` to create measures for active and inactive employees, attrition rate, and satisfaction metrics.
- **Custom Visualizations**: Designed insightful visualizations, including line charts, treemaps, and stacked columns, to present key HR metrics clearly.
- **User-Friendly Layout**: Implemented a clean, branded report design with intuitive navigation to enhance usability for HR teams.

## Getting Started
To explore the report, you can download the Power BI `.pbix` file from this repository and open it in Power BI Desktop.

### Requirements
- Power BI Desktop

### Repository Structure
- **.csv files**: HR datasets (synthetic data).
- **HR analytics.pbix**: The Power BI report file.
- **HR analytics.pdf**: The Power BI report file in pdf.

## About the Project
In this Power BI case study, we explored HR data to help Atlas Labs understand and manage their workforce effectively. The dashboard enables the HR team to analyze employee demographics, track hiring and performance metrics, and assess attrition. Key insights uncovered include trends in employee age, gender diversity, and factors contributing to attrition, such as travel frequency.

### Key Insights Uncovered
1. Majority of employees are between 20-29 years old.
2. Atlas Labs employs 2.7% more women than men.
3. Employees identifying as non-binary make up 8.5% of the workforce.
4. White employees have the highest average salary, while those from "Mixed or multiple ethnic groups" have one of the lowest.
5. Frequent travelers show a higher attrition rate despite representing only 19% of total hires, suggesting that travel requirements may impact employee retention.

## Lessons Learned
This project provided hands-on experience in building a comprehensive, reusable Power BI report, covering topics such as:
- Data modeling and creating relationships between tables
- Writing DAX measures to calculate key HR metrics
- Developing a user-friendly report layout with interactive navigation
